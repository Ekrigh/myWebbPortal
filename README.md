# myWebbPortal
Group assignment in my backendcourse be4 merging my code with my teammembers
the assignment was to individually build logic of our choosing and then merging it in the end of the course.

We built a backend for a webportal for reserving padelcourts, booking restaurant tables, cinema tickets. hiring motorcykles etc.
I was in charge of building the base of the application including all logic for users/customers that were "reoccuring" in all our individual businesslogic.

the code uploaded is my entire contribution including logic for padelcourts that were "my" responsibility.
this is the state of the project be4 we started merging in my teammembers responsibilities , ie endpoints/services/repos for restaurants,cinemas,motorbikes etc.
